### How does it works:
You have to enter the username of the GitHub user and the script will try to find a telegram account link, then mailboxes in GitHub public API and mailboxes in commits in the end. The script will show mail owner along with parsed mailboxes and the same for the telegram account link, so you can compare if account owners have the same names. Script also ignores forked and archived repos and verifies that the commit belongs to the GitHub account owner. In cases, when the GitHub account owner merges a pull request the script will show the mailbox of the pull request author.
